Motivation:
    - Constructors do not convey intent because they
     must be named after a class.
    - Particularly a problem when there are many constructors
    in a class
    - leads to dead constructors
Solution
    - static or non-static creation methods
    - name the clearly expresses intent
    - also may be necessary to extract a subclass
Limitation
    - Some classes are instantiated with new and some are not
    Non-standard
